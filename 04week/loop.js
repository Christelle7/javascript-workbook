//Create a new file called loops.js in the /04week folder of your workbook.
//Complete each of the following exercises.
for loop
Use a for loop to console.log each item in the array carsInReverse.
for...in loop
Create an object (an array with keys and values) called persons with the following data:
firstName: "Jane"
lastName: "Doe"
birthDate: "Jan 5, 1925"
gender: "female"
Use a for...in loop to console.log each key.
Then use a for...in loop and if state to console.log the value associated with the key birthDate.
while loop
Use a for loop to console.log the numbers 1 to 1000.
do...while loop
Use a do...while loop to console.log the numbers from 1 to 1000.
When is a for loop better than a while loop?
How is the readability of the code affected?
What is the difference between a for loop and a for...in loop?
What is the difference between a while loop and a do...while loop?
